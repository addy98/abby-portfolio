            "text": "Million Mile Secrets, a travel brand, was in need of redesign to narrow down their content and focus their attention on the right users. The goal of the rebrand was to create a more engaging experience on-site with new features and enhancements that was tailored to a target audience. If successful, the brand would be the singular destination for travel exploration and planning."

            "text": "Bringing together the larger team, the creative team hosted co-creations to evaluate where the brand stood and where we wanted it to go. Through tailored exercises, we re-defined key brand identifiers like audience, values, benefits, etc. that would shape the new visual identity."

We planned to introduce net-new features like destination guides, travel hacks, credit cards partnerships, etc. that aimed to show users how to travel farther on less."

            "text": "As an intern, this was an incredible learning opportunity for me to be a part of the entire process creating a brand. The autonomy I received to take on the homepage as my own was instrumental for my growth that summer. The project, unfortunately, was never taken to development as it was absorbed into another brand. Nonetheless, I still learned a lot about collaboration between creative and different functional roles."
