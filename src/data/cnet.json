Towards the middle of 2022, the Money division of CNET was carved out of M&C and brought into the Financial Services vertical. My team and I were tasked with mending CNET Money to become more transactional and timely while keeping the transition seamless within the brand."

Utilizing FigJam, each functional group laid out the needs, wants, and good-to-haves for the three transactional templates we focused on. From there, we recognized common threads that would help drive the creative solutions to come."

Starting small, we analyzed structural components like grids, containers, and content layouts, then worked up to reusable components like navigation, bylines, and list elements. We assembled a new library that fit within the CNET brand but better suited our highly transactional content needs."

Rather than work on one template at a time before going live, we built everything out on the creative side while the dev team shifted to a new tech stack. This gave our team a more holistic look into how these components would behave and interact with each other in each new template before going live."

With all these changes intertwined with the visual work our team completed, we saw massive wins for CNET Money post-launch."
